### Polynomial Exact Schedulability and Infeasibility Test for Fixed-Priority Scheduling on Multiprocessor Platforms: Experiments

This repository represent experiments for evaluating the schedulability performance of our algorithms 1 and 2 of the paper "Polynomial Exact Schedulability and Infeasibility Test for Fixed-Priority Scheduling on Multiprocessor Platforms".

The repository has the following structure. The `SchedulingTestingExperiments.lsp` file contains algorithms used in experiments. The `csv` paper contains results of experiments. The `png` paper contains pictures generated by tabular data from the `csv` paper with the help of `Scilab` tool \[https://www.scilab.org/  \].
